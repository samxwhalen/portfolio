LIMERENCE BREAKER 
(incomplete / in progress) 

A simple python program to help break up obsessive thoughts about a person. This program allows the user to store positive traits (as a way of purging thoughts) and negative actions/traits that are used to help a person maintain no contact with their object of affection.
